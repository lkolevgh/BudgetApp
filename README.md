# BudgetApp
An web application that preforms budget related tasks. Tracks expenses and incomes, lists them acordingly, and then calculates overall budget for the given month based on the expenses/incomes listed. The very left box is in charge of determing whether it's an expense or income, so click on it pick your desired choice.
